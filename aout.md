# Henry B. Goss
My name is Henry Goss and I am a first year student at St Lawrence University. I live in Rebert South this year and I am really glad I got a dorm that was recently remodeled. I am also on the rowing team at St. Lawrence University despite never having rowed before. My main reasoning for participating in crew was so I could stay in good shape and meet new friends. I have an interest in the medical field so I plan on majring in either biology, biochemistry or biomedical sciences. I have shadowing experience in the fields of oncology, family medicine, general surgery, internal medicine, emergency medicine, orthipedic surgery. Aditionally, I have shadowed a general dentist and two different oral surgeons. Overall, I am a hard worker with a passion for learning to benefit everyone involved.
## My Hobbies
I have many hobbies that range from a variety of diciplines. During the summer I love to fish, jet ski, boat and hike. Being from the Lake Ontario region, I really love fishing for Bass, Salmon and many Trout varieties. My favorite part of this is the peace and quiet i experience while getting to witness the incredible creatures in their natural habitat. I always catch and release so that the next person can get the same expience and thrill from fishing. Boating, jet skiing and hiking all also allow me to experience in differnt ways. Some days I want to challenge myself hiking and other days I want the thrill of going fast on a jet ski or boat. In the fall, I really like to hike and hunt. Hunting for me is also about being able to either sit or walk in the woods amongst the beatiful fall colors. My family also hunts so it is a great way to enjoy the woods with my family. In the winter I do a lot of skiing, and snowmobiling. I have grown up doing these things and it is just such a great way to stay active during the winter instead of sitting inside. During the spring i really like to fish but I also love woodworking because I like starting with rough boards and ending up with a finished product you can barely believe was made from the rough sawn boards. Furthermore, i really like to read  because it such a relaxing way to learn so much and be entertained while keeping my mind sharp.

## My Favorite Quote
> Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.
